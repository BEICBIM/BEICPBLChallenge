# Phase Seven: Summative Assessment

The summative assessment is a measure of student learning and achievement of overall learning objectives of this Project Based Learning (PBL) experience. It depends mostly on student contribution in phases 3 and 4 and content in their respective slack project site.  The summative assessment should be weighted as follows:

1. Demonstrated knowledge of supporting Scientific, Technological, Engineering, Artistic, and Mathmatical principles (25%).
2. Project presentation and performance in individual role during the presentation as rated by the panel (25%).
3. A written exam covering the high level concepts presented in the subject matter expertise phase and the major supporting STEAM principles of your project (25%).
4. Overall attendance and contributions to the project (rated 1-10) as the average rating of your team and teacher (25%).
