# BEIC Project Based Learning Challenge

A Challenge Curriculum for Project Based Learning Through Innovative Built Environment Project Development.

The organization of this challenge curricula is inspired by the practical 7 phase model described by Amber Graeber on edutopia.org.  Buck Institute for Education is another source of information on quality project based learning experiences. 

* Validation, planning, and development of sustainable, viable, built environments is a primary focus.
* Mentored students attempt to solve engaging, real world problems that consider innovative built environment solutions.
*  Authentic roles that students take on include: 
  * Property owner/manager 
  * Designer/architect/engineer 
  * General contractor/builder/construction manager
* Mentored students may work collaboratively doing Building Information Modelling (BIM) to envision solutions and prepare integrated collaborative execution agreements to deliver them. 

The phases of a Built Environment Innovation Challenge are:

* [Phase One: A Driving Question Question About The Built Environment](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase1/TOC.md)
* [Phase Two: A Built Environment Requirement & Opportunity for Innovation](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase2/TOC.md)
* [Phase Three: Developing Subject Matter Expertise to Meet the Requirement](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/TOC.md)
* [Phase Four: Design and Development of a Built Environment Project Proposal](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase4/TOC.md)
* [Phase Five: Debriefing the Built Environment Project Proposal](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase5/TOC.md)
* [Phase Six: Responding to the Driving Question About The Built Environment](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase6/TOC.md)
* [Phase Seven: Summative Assessment](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase7/TOC.md)

The content of this challnge curriculum is also inspired by the National Institute of Building Sciences' Science Technology Engineering and Math (STEM) program for Sustainable Facilities and Infrastructure in Constrained Environments (SuFICE) as well as Integrated Project Delivery resources and guidance from built environment industry professionals.
