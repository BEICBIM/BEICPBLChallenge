# Phase Two: A Built Environment Requirement & Opportunity for Innovation

In this phase, [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge) participants form integrated collaborative project teams around actual expressed requirements for built environment improvements.  The challenge for students on integrated collaborative project teams is to plan and virtually develop a viable built environment solution that addresses the driving question and aspires to meet the expressed requirement.  Teams will consist of:

1. Real property [owner](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Owner.md)’s representatives (e.g. land, facilities, and infrastructure managers for public or private owners)

2. [Designers](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Designer.md) (e.g. architects, engineers, planners, and artists)

3. [Constructors](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Constructor.md) (e.g. construction managers and trades, engineers, landscapers, mechanical & electrical technicians, plumbers).  

## The Process...

The planning and virtual development process employed in a Built Environment Innovation Challenge, in the pursuit of a viable built environment solution, is essentially a basic [Systems Engineering](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Systems_Engineering) development process.  The development approach elaborates on a “primitive need” (expresed requirement) through a set of Systems Engineering development activities.  Although these activities are presented below in a sequential listing they are not neccesarily sequential in nature.  Rather, each activity can feed information forward or feed information back to other system development activities.

### Business Analysis:

This activity initiates the life cycle of the system of interest by defining the problem domain and potential opportunity for built environment innovation.  This process captures important information, such as identifying:
* The major [stakeholders](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(glossary)) involved.  
* The environmental conditions and constraints that bound the solution domain.  
This enables an integrated collaborative project team to develop preliminary life cycle concepts for the delivery, operation & maintenance, and retirement of a built environment system.

### Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition

In this activity the team conducts stakeholder analysis, considers boundaries, examines scenarios and analyzes functions in order to identify and define requirements.  Some requirements are purely functional (what must the built environment system solution actually achieve), others are non-functional and some deal with legal or environmental considerations.  The team must also understand and develop appropriate metrics and measures of performance in order to refine and breakdown the expressed requirement into "good" more-specific requirements.  These are the preliminary steps in developing a Value System or Value Model that helps capture and communicate this aggregation of requirements and is useful later for analysis of built environment solution alternatives and decision making.

## For a Successful Outcome...

For a successful outcome you will need to present preliminary deliverables of a built environment solution that:

1. Captures the expressed requirements and criteria for meeting them as well as addresses viability from a life-cycle perspective.

2. Is used to communicate to permitting agencies for approval & local stakeholders for comment.

3. Integrates viability, sufficiency, functionality, aesthetics, resilience, and sustainability, consistent with owner values. 

For a *very* successful outcome, your team will translate your successful outcome into a draft collaborative agreement to actually fund and execute your built environment solution.  

For an *extremely* successful outcome your team’s draft collaborative execution agreement will contain a specification that will foster efficient information exchange all the way through the long term performance measurement of your built environment solution.
