# Phase Two: A Built Environment Requirement & Opportunity for Innovation

In this phase, [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge) participants form integrated collaborative project teams around actual ["primitive needs" (expressed requirements) for built environment improvements](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase2/Requirements/Readme%26TOC.md).  The challenge for students on integrated collaborative project teams is to plan and virtually develop a viable built environment solution that addresses the driving question and aspires to meet the expressed requirement.  Teams will consist of:

1. Real property [owner](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Owner.md)’s representatives (e.g. land, facilities, and infrastructure managers for public or private owners)

2. [Designers](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Designer.md) (e.g. architects, engineers, planners, and artists)

3. [Constructors](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Constructor.md) (e.g. construction managers and trades, engineers, landscapers, mechanical & electrical technicians, plumbers).  

## The Process...

The planning and virtual development process employed in a Built Environment Innovation Challenge, in the pursuit of a viable built environment solution, is essentially a basic [Systems Engineering](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Systems_Engineering) development process.  The development approach elaborates on a “primitive need” (expresed requirement) through a set of Systems Engineering development activities.  Although these activities are presented below in a sequential listing they are not neccesarily sequential in nature.  Rather, each activity can feed information forward or feed information back to other system development activities.

### Business Analysis:

This activity initiates the life cycle of the system of interest by defining the problem domain and potential opportunity for built environment innovation.  This process captures important information, such as identifying:
* The major [stakeholders](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/Stakeholder_(glossary)) involved.  
* The environmental conditions and constraints that bound the solution domain.  
This enables an integrated collaborative project team to develop preliminary life cycle concepts for the delivery, operation & maintenance, and retirement of a built environment system.

### Stakeholder Needs and Requirements Definition

In this activity the team conducts stakeholder analysis, considers boundaries, examines scenarios and analyzes functions in order to identify and define requirements.  Some requirements are purely functional (what must the built environment system solution actually achieve), others are non-functional and some deal with legal or environmental considerations.  The team must also understand and develop appropriate metrics and measures of performance in order to refine and breakdown the expressed requirement into "good" more-specific requirements.  These are the preliminary steps in developing a Value System or Value Model that helps capture and communicate this aggregation of requirements and is useful later for analysis of built environment solution alternatives and decision making.

### Built Environment System Requirements Definition

In this activity the team establishes what is "in" the built environment solution system.  The team also determins what other systems will the "new" built environment solution system will interact with and how.  In conducting this activity the team acheives a thorough understanding the of problem space and can better articulate the range of associated requirements with the expressed requirement.

The most important aspect of this activity is to clarify the teams understanding of the problem(s) to be solved and desirable outcomes or built environment system "emergences" to be achieved.  In this activity the team uses system engineering techniques to clarify the needs and refine requirements.  The objective for the team in this activity is articulating what the owner (and other key stakeholders) expect from the built environment system solution.  This is critical in defining requirements and the overall conceptual solution design.  This activity is also where the team gains knowledge of the stakeholders, what they stand to gain, and what they can invest in a built environment solution.

### Architecture Definition

During this activity the team will:
* Create and establish alternative architectures for the built environment solution through several views and models.
* Assess the properties of the alternatives (supported by [System Analysis](http://sebokwiki.org/wiki/System_Analysis)). 
* Select appropriate technological or technical system elements that compose the built environment solution.

### Design Definition

In this activity the team addresses all implementation technologies and their assimilation such as mechanical fixtures and equipment, electronical and electronic fixtures and equipment, software, chemical equipment, human operations, and/or services, etc.  Design provides the "implement-to" level of definition, such as preliminary [Building Information Modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_information_modeling) (BIM) content and other kinds of detailed design content.

### Built Environment Solution System Analysis

The team analyzes the entire built environment system solution or parts of the system quantitatively in this activity.  This activity supports reliable and objective trade-off studies also performed by the team during this activity.  An essential value of this actvity is bringing order to an otherwise chaotic process of decision-making among built environment system solution alternatives.  The team will learn several different decision-support methodologies along with their capabilities and limitations during this activity as well.

### BIM Simulation and Evaluation

In this activity the team uses simulation techniques, as applicable, to demonstrate if the built environment model content under consideration can meet (at least virtually) the requirements, and if its performance can satisfy (at least virtually) the usability needs of both the owner and end users.

### Lifecycle Considerations

In this activity the team establishes notional requirements to operate the proposed built environment solution, and the means to monitor the assocated services and built environment solution system performance.  In order to sustain the solution the team also identifies and analyzes operational anomalies in relation to existing agreements, stakeholder requirements and organizational constraints.

## For a Successful Outcome...

For a successful outcome you will need to present preliminary deliverables of a built environment solution that:

1. Captures the expressed requirements and criteria for meeting them as well as addresses viability from a life-cycle perspective.

2. Is used to communicate to permitting agencies for approval & local stakeholders for comment.

3. Integrates viability, sufficiency, functionality, aesthetics, resilience, and sustainability, consistent with owner values. 

For a *very* successful outcome, your team will translate your successful outcome into a draft collaborative agreement to actually fund and execute your built environment solution.  

For an *extremely* successful outcome your team’s draft collaborative execution agreement will contain a specification that will foster efficient information exchange all the way through the long term performance measurement of your built environment solution.
