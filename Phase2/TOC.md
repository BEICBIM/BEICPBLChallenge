Your challenge as a Integrated Project Delivery Team is to plan and virtually develop a viable built environment solution that adresses the driving question and aspires to meet the expressed requirement.  Your team will consist of:

1. Real property owner’s representatives (e.g. land, facilities, and infrastructure managers for public or private owners)

2. Designers (e.g. architects, engineers, planners, and artists)

3. Constructors (e.g. construction managers and trades, engineers, landscapers, mechanical & electrical technicians, plumbers).  

For a successful outcome you will need to present preliminary deliverables of a built environment solution that:

1. Captures the expressed requirements and addresses viability from the life-cycle perspective.

2. Is used to communicate to permitting agencies for approval & local stakeholders for comment.

3. Integrates viability, sufficiency, functionality, aesthetics, resilience, and sustainability. 

For a very successful outcome, your team will translate your successful outcome into a draft Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) agreement to actually fund and execute your built environment solution.  

For an extremely successful outcome your team’s Integrated Project Delivery Agreement will contain a specification that will foster efficient information exchange all the way through the long term performance measurement of your built environment solution.
