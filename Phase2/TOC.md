# Phase Two: A Built Environment Requirement & Opportunity for Innovation

The challenge for students on integrated collaborative project teams is to plan and virtually develop a viable built environment solution that addresses the driving question and aspires to meet the expressed requirement.  Teams will consist of:

1. Real property [owner](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Owner.md)’s representatives (e.g. land, facilities, and infrastructure managers for public or private owners)

2. Designers (e.g. architects, engineers, planners, and artists)

3. Constructors (e.g. construction managers and trades, engineers, landscapers, mechanical & electrical technicians, plumbers).  

## For a Successful Outcome...

For a successful outcome you will need to present preliminary deliverables of a built environment solution that:

1. Captures the expressed requirements and criteria for meeting them as well as addresses viability from a life-cycle perspective.

2. Is used to communicate to permitting agencies for approval & local stakeholders for comment.

3. Integrates viability, sufficiency, functionality, aesthetics, resilience, and sustainability, consistent with owner values. 

For a *very* successful outcome, your team will translate your successful outcome into a draft collaborative agreement to actually fund and execute your built environment solution.  

For an *extremely* successful outcome your team’s draft collaborative execution agreement will contain a specification that will foster efficient information exchange all the way through the long term performance measurement of your built environment solution.
