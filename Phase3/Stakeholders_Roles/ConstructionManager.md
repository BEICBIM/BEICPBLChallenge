# Construction Manager
## Planning & Scheduling
### Planning & Scheduling Overview
A construction manager must understand the basic concepts of project management and control. Construction managers recognize the need for both planning and scheduling, and why those two activities are different but dependent.  With a mastery of these basic concepts construction managers are ready for estimating and scheduling techniques, selection of construction activities, the criteria for selecting a project scheduling approach, and the basic concepts of construction logic.

### Project Planning
A construction project can be a complex choreography involving many activities and players. Compared to a manufacturing system such as an assembly line, construction projects are more inherently unique in design and execution.  Projects can often be accomplished using a variety of means and methods.  The tasks that make up a project may be accomplished with some variation in sequence.  However, construction managers must effectively plan to organize complex tasks so that they are accomplished on time, in the right order, and coordinated with other activities on the site for minimal disruption.  Planning involves the process of selecting the most appropriate method and order of work.  Project planning and plans may be general to detailed in nature but should always sufficiently address the following items:

* What tasks to perform.
* How to perform them. 
* Who will perform them.
* The order or sequence of performance.

After the construction manager has sufficiently addressed these items, informed project scheduling can start.

### Project Scheduling
Scheduling involves the determination of the timing and sequence of operations in the project and their assemblage that results in overerall project duration. This forms a baseline that allows for an objective measure of progress and predictability of completion by an expected date. The schedule is and expression of a rational allocation of time and resources to each activity that must be completed in order for the project to be completed. 

### Project Activities
Recall that during the planning process, the construction manager establishes the **activities** that must be accomplished for project completion. In general, activities must be:

* Discrete. Defined by a known scope, known duration, known resources, and specific start and end dates.
* Measurable. The work included within the scope of the activity must be measurable in some objective way (e.g. % completed).
* Significant. The activity must have an effect on the project's overall completion.

When selcting activities, construction managers need to consider the following things:

* Pay or Bid Items specifically broken out in either the bid or the progress payment schedule as line items.
* Subcontractor items such as roofing, HVAC work, structural steel erection, etc.
* Specification section included items such as masonry or concrete unless:
 * There are instances where work included within a particular specification section will occur at widely separated intervals throughout the project. 
 * Certain phases of work, such as roofing, are controlled by multiple specification sections.
* Major project milestones including completion dates, ends of phases, etc.
* Coordination points include where different subcontractors interact or coordination with the owner or other parties, projects, or contracts is required.
* Trades & Trade Phases may be broken down individually and possibly by locations or areas of work.
