# Construction Manager
## Planning & Scheduling
### Planning & Scheduling overview
A construction manager must understand the basic concepts of project management and control. Construction managers recognize the need for both planning and scheduling, and why those two activities are different but dependent.  With a mastery of these basic concepts construction managers are ready for estimating and scheduling techniques, selection of construction activities, the criteria for selecting a project scheduling approach, and the basic concepts of construction logic.
