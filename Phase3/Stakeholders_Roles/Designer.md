# The Designer's Role in a Built Environment Innovation Challenge

This content is intended for students who are exploring the role of a design professional as a part of a [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/README.md).  **Architects, engineers and other design professionals** provide the essential services for the *visualizion* and *simulation* of the _owner's requirements_, and _coordinated solutions_ to meet them.  In a built environment innovation challange, designers must ensure their visualization and simulation of the owners requirements stays in sync across the network of interdependent relationships among the owner, designer(s), constructor(s) and the various parts, components, and subsystems that comprise the optimal solution.  These services are essential to achieving common understanding and optimizing performance of a built environment project solution that meets or exceeds the owners requirements.

The design deliverable of a built environment innovation challenge is a preliminary version of a *virtual model*.  A key characteristic of this model is that it is *parametric* and can capture, manage, and show relationships between the various parts, components, and subsystems that comprise an alternative solution.    

## Architect
An architect's services are essentially the art and science of creating an optimal "built environment user experience".  This refers to the experience the owner has expressing a built environment requirement, as well as the experience the people who will utilize spaces created to meet the requirement will have.  The users' activities within these spaces are based upon particular functions.  For example, a warehouse and an operating room are types of spaces that support very different users and functions.  The successful architect must enable the integration of *objective* confrimations that functional requirements of spaces are met with *subjective* confirmations that the same spaces will please the people that will use them.   

## Engineer
An [engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer) is any one of a wide variety of professionals that may provide expert services in design, analysis, and management within a broad professional field comprised of many engineering disciplines.  Some examples of engineering disciplines that are *commonly* associated with the built environment industry are: 

* [Civil](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/civil-engineering)
* [Electrical](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/electrical-engineering)
* [Fire Protection](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/fire-protection-engineering)
* [Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning (HVAC), and Refridgeration](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/hvac-refrigerating-engineering)
* [Information Technology (IT)](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/information-technologies-engineering)
* [Plumbing](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/plumbing-engineering)
* [Structural](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/structural-engineering)

## Other Built Environment Related Design Professions
Examples of other design disciplines that are *commonly* associated with the built environment industry include but are not limited to:

* [Interior Designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interior_design)
* [Landscape Architects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_architecture)
* [Service Designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_design)
* [Spatial Designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_design)
* [Urban Designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_design)
