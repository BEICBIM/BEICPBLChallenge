# The Designer's Role in a Built Environment Innovation Challenge

This content is intended for students who are exploring the role of a design professional as a part of a [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/README.md).  Architects, engineers and other design professionals provide the essential services of visualizing and simulating the owner's requirements and alternative solutions to meet them.  These services are essential to achieving common understanding and optimizing performance of a built environment project solution that meets or exceeds the owners requirements.  

## Architect
An architect's services are essentially the art and science of creating an optimal "built environment user experience".  This refers to the experience the owner has expressing a built environment requirement, as well as the experience the people who will utilize spaces created to meet the requirement will have.     

## Engineer
An [engineer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer) is any one of a wide variety of professionals that may provide expert services in design, analysis, and management within a broad professional field comprised of many engineering disciplines.  Some examples of engineering disciplines that are *commonly* associated with the built environment industry are: 

* [Civil](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/civil-engineering)
* [Electrical](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/electrical-engineering)
* [Fire Protection](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/fire-protection-engineering)
* [Heating, Ventilation, Air-Conditioning (HVAC), and Refridgeration](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/hvac-refrigerating-engineering)
* [Information Technology (IT)](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/information-technologies-engineering)
* [Plumbing](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/plumbing-engineering)
* [Structural](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/structural-engineering)
