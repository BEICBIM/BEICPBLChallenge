# Owner

This content is intended for students who are exploring the role of a owner or representative of the owner as a part of a [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/README.md).  In this context an "owner" refers to and individual, group, organization (or their designated representative) that has a lawful, undisputed claim to fixed property (e.g. land, stationary facilities, or infrastructure) who has an ["expressed requirement" (as defined in Phase One)](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase1/TOC.md).

The owner's role and participation in a successful project *team* and project is particularly important during early project development for a succesful project.  This starts with refining the "5W's" of the built requirement of phase one into a complete and clear statement of work or scope.  This fundemental content the owner must contribute, must be well thought out and capture the *extent* of relevant subject matter that the project team must deal with during planning, design, and delivery in order to satisfy the **full requirement**.  It must clearly establish a successful project's functional, performance, and aesthetic objectives to be met within spatial and temporal limits.  Incomplete or ambigous scope puts the project at risk for cost growth, schedule growth, litigation, and failure.
