# Owner

This content is intended for students who are exploring the role of a owner or representative of the owner as a part of a [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/README.md).  In this context an "owner" refers to and individual, group, organization (or their designated representative) that has a lawful, undisputed claim to fixed property (e.g. land, stationary facilities, or infrastructure) who has an ["expressed requirement" (as defined in Phase One)](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase1/TOC.md).

The owner's role and participation in establishing a successful project *team* (one that is enabled to *deliver* a successful project) is particularly important.  This may start with the owner refining the "5W's" of an "expressed requirement" (as described in Phase One of a Built Environment Innovation Challenge) into a clearly written request for open source planning and project development support from the community built environment industry professionals, experts, educators, and students.  This fundemental initializing content contributed by owners should concisely capture the *extent* of relevant subject matter that an open source project team must deal with during planning, design, and delivery in order to satisfy the **full requirement** at the owner's property.  It must clearly establish a the project's preformance objectives (ecological, financial, functional, and aesthetical), and its spatial and temporal limits.  This initializing content may be posted in blog form (e.g. on the [BEIC blog](https://beicoop.wordpress.com/blog/)) for general access and comment, and a "Git" repsository (e.g. on GitHub) for fostering collabloration with version control.
