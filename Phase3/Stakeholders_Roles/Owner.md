# Owner

This content is intended for students who are exploring the role of a owner or representative of the owner as a part of a [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/README.md).  In this context an "owner" refers to and individual, group, organization (or their designated representative) that has a lawful, undisputed claim to fixed property (e.g. land, stationary facilities, or infrastructure) who has an ["expressed requirement" (as defined in Phase One)](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase1/TOC.md).

The owner's role and participation in establishing a successful project *team* (one that is enabled to *deliver* a successful project) is particularly important.  This may start with the owner summarizing the "5W's" of an "expressed requirement" (as described in Phase One of a Built Environment Innovation Challenge) into a clearly written Request For Support (RFS) for open-source Planning and Project Development (PPD) from the community built environment industry professionals, experts, educators, and students.  This fundamental initializing content contributed by owners should concisely capture the *extent* of relevant subject matter that an open source project team must deal with during planning, design, and delivery in order to satisfy the **full requirement** at the owner's property.  It must clearly establish a the main performance objectives (ecological, financial, functional, and aesthetical), and spatial and temporal limits for the set of alternatives to meet the requirement.  This initializing content may be posted in blog form (e.g. on the [BEIC blog](https://beicoop.wordpress.com/blog/)) for general access and comment, and a "Git" repository (e.g. on GitHub) for fostering collaboration with version control.

A clearly written RFS for open source PPD from an owner should solicit for team members with architecture, construction management, and engineering (ACE) expertise and include the folowing content:

1. Summarized requirement 5W's.
2. Main perfromance objectives and spatial and temporal limits for the set of alternatives to meet the requirement.
3. Timeframe alloted for planning and project development effort.
4. Budget alloted (by hours and rate) broken out for architect, construction management, and engineering consulting support.
5. Deliverables such as:
  * Open source analysis of alternatives to meet the requirement with reccomended alternative.
  * Open source signature-ready project execution agreement for Integrated Project Delivery (IPD).
6. Knowledge, skills, abilities, and experience desired of team members such as:
  * Work on similar requirements.
  * Experience on design-build projects or familiarity open source collaboration project teams.
  * Experience or familiarity with using shared file servers and collaborative Information Technology tools.
  * Experience or familiarity with high perfromance fostering management techniques (e.g. Lean) on cross disciplanry teams.
