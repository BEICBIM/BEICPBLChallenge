# The Constructor's Role in a Built Environment Innovation Challenge

This content is intended for students who are exploring the role of a Constructor (or [Construction Manager](https://youtu.be/jNgsSdRqsh0)) as a part of a [Built Environment Innovation Challenge](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/README.md).  [Designers](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Designer.md) and constructors are sometimes integral to the same organization, such as a Design-Build frim.  In the context of a built environment innovation challenge, constructors refer to those professionals that provide the essenetial services neccesary to *realize* a coordinated solution to owner [requirements](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase1/TOC.md).  These services include:
* Planning
* Permitting
* Estimating
* Scheduling
* Sub-contract administration
* Procurement
* Logistics
* Supervisory control

This essential role spans from the early planning and development of projects, through project execution and delivery (or realization).  A Construction Manager should have a good understanding of the basics concepts of project management and control *and* must integrate key information from this understanding into the layers of the information model established by the [Designer](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Designer.md) **early in project planning and development efforts**. This is essential for increasing the likelihood that the (virtual) information model can be a *successfully realized*.  For the information model to be successfuly realized, the built environment system that it visualizes and simulates should be able to demonstrate to the owner (virtually) that the system solution is *constructable*, and the most *efficient* and *effective* approach to constructing it. 

The early planning and project development role of the Construction Manager (in response to the owner's Request For Support, and in collaboration with the owner and designer) is the priamry focus of a Built Environment Innovation Challenge.

## Project Planning & Scheduling
As introduced above, construction manager must understand the basic concepts of project management and control. Construction managers recognize the need for both project planning and scheduling, and why those two activities are different but dependent.  With a mastery of these basic concepts construction managers are ready for [estimating](http://www.wbdg.org/design-disciplines/cost-estimating) and scheduling techniques, selection of construction activities, the criteria for selecting a project scheduling approach, and the basic concepts of construction logic.  This type of information makes up an essential source of the non-graphical content contributed to the building information modelling done by the project delivery team on a high perfroming project.

### Project Planning
A construction project can be a complex choreography involving many **activities** and players. Compared to a manufacturing system such as an assembly line, individual construction projects are more inherently unique in both design and execution.  This aspect is why many built environment projects contain opportunities for innovation during their delivery.  Projects can often be accomplished using a variety of means and methods.  The tasks that make up a project may be accomplished with some variation in sequence.  However, construction managers must effectively plan to organize complex tasks so that they are accomplished on time, in the right order, and coordinated with other activities on the site for minimal disruption.  Planning involves the process of selecting the most appropriate method and order of work.  Project planning and plans may be general to detailed in nature but should always sufficiently address the following items:

* What tasks to perform.
* How to perform them. 
* Who will perform them.
* The order or sequence of performance.

After the construction manager has sufficiently addressed these items, informed project scheduling can start.

### Project Scheduling
Scheduling involves the determination of the timing and sequence of operations in the project and their assemblage that results in overerall project duration. This forms a baseline that allows for an objective measure of progress and predictability of completion by an expected date. The schedule is and expression of a rational allocation of time and resources to each activity that must be completed in order for the project to be completed. 

### Project Activities
Recall that during the planning process, the construction manager establishes the **activities** that must be accomplished for project completion. In general, activities must be:

* Discrete. Defined by a known scope, known duration, known resources, and specific start and end dates.
* Measurable. The work included within the scope of the activity must be measurable in some objective way (e.g. % completed).
* Significant. The activity must have an effect on the project's overall completion.

When selcting activities, construction managers need to consider the following things:

* Specific pay or bid items that are broken out in bid or payment schedule documentation.
* Subcontracted items such as roofing, HVAC work, structural steel erection, etc.
* [System & specification](http://www.wbdg.org/systems-specifications) section items.
* Major project milestones including completion dates, ends of phases, etc.
* Coordination points include where different subcontractors interact or coordination with the owner or other parties, projects, or contracts is required.
* Trades & Trade Phases may be broken down individually and possibly by locations or areas of work.

Project activities can be grouped hierarchically within these four general levels (from highest to lowest):
* Project Phases
* Major activities
* Minor activities
* Milestones  

**Project phases** may have multiple uses and durations from months to years.  At the *highest level* of project planning, the owner can identify phases such as project funding, delivery team selection, and execution.  The project team can also look at different *phases of execution*, especially in those cases where the execution agreement (contract) is large and complex and the execution team needs to maintain visibility and control of things like:

* Separable completion dates for different items of work.
* Priority of effort on different items of work.
* Scheduling constraints and requirements, including known/planned work stoppages, etc.
* Work sequencing constraints

The next level down in the hierarchy of project planning is the *major or master activity*. These activities may range in duration from weeks to months. They are typically based upon major construction trades such as "steelworkers", or specification divisions such as "Concrete", or on subcontracted items such as "Sprinkler Systems".  Master activities are useful for breaking down the project into manageable pieces, which can then be allocated out to different memebers of the project delivery team (e.g. estimators, subcontractors, etc.) Simple bar charts based upon activities at roughly this level of detail may be generated from the buidling information modelling tool to help concisely explain the execution of project.

## The Constructor's Deliverables

### 1. Post a response to the Request For Support (RFS) for open-source Planning and Project Development (PPD) posted by the owner:
Constructors will also post a open source proposal in response to the Request For Support (RFS) for open-source Planning and Project Development (PPD) posted by the [owner'](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Owner.md) that is similar, informed by, and complementary to the [Designer's](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/Designer.md) deliverables.  In the case of design-build firms the designer and constructor are the same.

After a careful review of all the open source content posted by the owner (as well as any open source Request For Information (RFI) content that has been posted by designer) the constructor should also formulate, organize, and consolidate any questions the constructor has about the owners requirements (or the deisgner's response content) into a concise, organized and summarized RFI's.

Be sure to request a time limit for responses to the RFI(s) from the owner and designer.  This is so that the owner and desiger has an understanding of when the construcor needs them, for a complete and timely response in support the owner's timeframe allotted for the PPD effort.  Review any responses the owner provides to the RFI(s) by the time requested, and publish an open source written response to the owners RFS by the time requested by the owner.  The RFS response should make it clear how the constructors' knowledge, skills, and abilities support the delivery of a solution that meets or exceeds owner-expressed requirements.
