# Phase Three: Developing Subject Matter Expertise to Meet the Requirement

There are key concepts in 3 broad categories of subject matter that we’ll need to develop in phase 3 of the Built Environment Innovation Challenge in order to successfully do our culminating challenge in phase 4.  These broad subject areas are:

1. [Key Stakeholders & Roles:](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase3/Stakeholders_Roles/TOC.md)
  * Owners, owners representatives, facility managers, and operators.
  * [Architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architect), [Construction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_management), and [Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construction_engineering) Professionals and Technical Specialists.
  * Permitting authorities.
  * Members of the community and general public.
2. Planning, Project Development, Design, and Delivery
  * [Open Source Methodology (germaine to built environments)](https://opensource.com/life/16/5/6-open-source-architecture-projects).
  * Integrated and Collaborative Design and Project Execution Agreements.
3. Built Environment Project and Asset Management 
  * Built Environment Information Modelling and Workflow.
  * Life-cycle Information Exchange.

Content for each of these sections will be posted on the student project team's slack channel in order to facilitate input from mentor subject matter experts from the built environment industry, and the completion of the action items the student project team will need to do in order to develop expertise.

## Action Items: Estimated duration 10 days

**Student Action:** With your mentor, discuss each of the general roles that key stakeholders play and what you think their respective interests are. 

During the Built Environment Innovation Challenge students may be working in one or more of these roles.  Mentors will work with students in school and on their project’s slack channel site as you develop expertise.  Students take some time to summarize on the first day what they think the individual and collective interests of the stakeholders on their project team are as they work together on a project. 

**Mentor Action:** Facilitate this discussion among students.  If you haven’t already done so have students read and summarize an initial answer to the driving question in phase 1 and review & discuss the introduction to the culminating challenge of phase 2.   Enter the summarized business interests your students came up with on the project slack channel.
