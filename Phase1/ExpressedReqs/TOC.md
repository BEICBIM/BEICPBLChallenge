# Expressed Requirement for a Built Environment Innovation
Use this section of the Built Environment Innovation Challenge repository to capture and elaborate on expressed requirements.  This documetation effort typically starts with a "primitive need statement that captures the 5W's".  This "primitive need" is essentially a stakeholder opinion based on casual observation, tempered with experienced judgement.  Over the course of a Built Environment Innovation Challenge, the initial "primitive need" expression is elaborated on (perhaps multiple times) to discern the "effective need" (or the comprehensive and underlying requirements) that must be met for an optimal solution.
