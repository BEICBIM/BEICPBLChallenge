# Published Solicitations for Built Environment Improvements
This section of the Built Environment Innovation Challenge repository is an aggregation of expressed built environment requirements.  It is intended for use for educational purposes in conjunction with a Built Environment Innovation Challenge project based learning experience.    The list complied here primarily draws from (but is not necessarily limited to) soliciation content posted on [Federal Business Opportuities (FBO)](https://www.fbo.gov/).  The FBO solcitiations aggregated below are typically ["Set Aside Coded"](https://www.fbo.gov/index?static=faqs&s=getstart&mode=list&tab=list&tabmode=list#q3a-13) opportunities classified as "construction of structures and facilities" or "maintenance, repair, and alteration of real property".  Students or other participants may find the content list below useful for documenting an [expressed requirement for a built environment innovation](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase1/ExpressedReqs/README%26TOC.md).
