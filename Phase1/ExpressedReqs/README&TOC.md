# Expressed Requirement for a Built Environment Innovation
Use this section of the Built Environment Innovation Challenge repository to capture and elaborate on expressed requirements.  This documetation effort may start with a "primitive need statement that captures the 5W's".  This "primitive need" is essentially a stakeholder opinion based on casual observation, tempered with experienced judgement.  Primitive need statements may also be extracted from [published solicitiation announcements for built environment requirements](https://github.com/BEICOOP/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase1/ExpressedReqs/PublishedSolicitations.md).  Over the course of a Built Environment Innovation Challenge, the initial "primitive need" expression is elaborated on (perhaps multiple times) to discern the "effective need" (or the comprehensive and underlying requirements) that must be met for an optimal solution. 

## "The Five W's" Template
Use this template and the contribution guidance to share stakeholder requirements for built environment innovations:

### 1. Where is the requirement?
Identify the specific proposed location here (e.g. post a URL to a Google map label).

### 2. What is the requirement? 
#### a. Describe the intended purpose.
Express the desired result or effect that establishes the requirement.  (e.g. "In order to get to Grandmother's house, I need a bridge over a the river and a path through the woods.") 
#### b. Identify potential built environment project activities that may be part of the requirement (may involve one or more):
* Repair
* Maintenance
* Modernization
* Re-purposing (and/or demolition)
* New Improvements
#### c. Identify a target price or budget constraints to mee the requirement:
This is an initial quantitative target price for the solution that meets the requirement or a budgetary constraint that the solution must stay within.  It should be expressed in a recognized value unit (e.g. U.S. Dollars, Mexican Pesos, Canadian Dollars, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, etc.). Be sure to provide as much break-out detail as possible.  (e.g. fixed, variable, and recurring items and amounts.)
#### d. Identify any other details about the requirement that you think are relevant.
Explain information that from experienced judgement would having a bearing on or connection with meeting the requirement successfully.  (e.g. other stakeholders, desirable and undesirable characteristics, adjacencies, etc.)

### 3. Who's expressing or has an interest in the requirement?
Identify the stakeholders, potential stakeholders, and their respective roles, realtion, and resources involved.

### 4. When was the requirement identified and a solution sought by?
Identify when the requirement was first discovered and when a complete and usable solution that achieves the intended purppose is needed.

### 5. Why is it a requirement?
Explain why doing nothing to meet the requirement is not an acceptable choice.
