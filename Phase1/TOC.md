# Phase One: A Driving Question Question About The Built Environment

Built environment innovations, large or small, start with a expressed requirement. In this context, a requirement refers to a need or a want for repair, maintenance, modernization, re-purposing, or an entirely new improvement at a specific location. It can be expressed (or communicated) through content such as text, diagrams, maps, etc. that concisely captures the "5W's":

* Where is the requirement?
* What is the requirement?
* Who is expressing or has an interest in the requirement?
* When was the requirement identified or discovered?
* Why is it a requirement?

Students or members of the public can share 5W's about requirements on BEIC's requirements input form. This content informs the "driving question" that initiates a Built Environment Innovation Challenge:

**What are three viable alternatives (choices or possible solutions) you think would meet the expressed requirement and what do you think makes them viable and preferable to a "do-nothing" alternative?**

The first experience for all students participating in a Built Environment Innovation Challenge is to discuss, think about, and respond to the challenge question. Subject matter experts from built environment related professions and trades review the responses. They then assess the range of knowledge-levels among participating students, and plan a charrette for students (assuming roles such as property-owner/manager, designer/builder, or regulator/permitting-authority, etc.) to participate in during the culminating challenge phase of a Built Environment Innovation Challenge.
