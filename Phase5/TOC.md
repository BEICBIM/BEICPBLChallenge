# Phase Five: Debriefing the Built Environment Project Proposal

Now that the students have presented their proposed built environment solution, it’s time for some reflection.  In this phase students write up their own personal assessment of their project's (1) strengths and (2) areas for improvement in each of the elements of their [culminating challenge presentation of phase 4](https://github.com/BEICBIM/BEICPBLChallenge/blob/master/Phase4/TOC.md).  The students and the panel of Subject Matter Experts SME’s then compare these notes on the relative strengths and potential areas for improvement they observed and discuss where your perceptions and observations may differ and why. -also what next step students might take to continue to improve their project and/or performance on the team.

The debriefing phase should be held, time permitting, on a day after the culminating challenge.  However, students and panel members should write down their reflections as soon as possible after doing the culminating challenge, preferably within a week.  This phase is meant to capture the value of reflection reflection after the challenge of phase 4, but should be done soon enough so that participant memory is relatively fresh.
